<p>MIT has a history of anecdotal evidence pointing to student support deficiencies with regard to services such as mental health and counseling. Some problems are not unique to MIT, such as service barriers due to office location or scheduling constraints. Such systematic issues in traditional counseling services indicate the need for a more immediate and convenient system for administering support. However, such obstacles have historically been overcome by additional staff and other workarounds, and typically it seems that such practices are sufficient to compensate. Yet there exist additional problems which show the current system for mental health support to be incomplete.</p>

<p>These problems are partially enumerated in a recent article of The Tech, which cites the Healthy Minds Study reporting that 49% of MIT undergraduates polled “‘question how serious my needs are’ as a barrier to seeking help” (implying a misconception that some problems aren’t serious enough to seek help for). In addition to students who are fearful of seeking help, some students who receive help are required to have return visits which may or may not be effective once the initial problem has already been dealt with. Anecdotal accounts point out that counselors may be disinterested in follow up appointments, or perhaps students are at fault themselves for failing to make an effort to continuously be open and honest with a professional whom they only know for and from one hour sessions each week. In any case, a disconnect can understandably exist, prompting students in many cases to prefer to check in with a fellow student or friend instead of a professional service to get help dealing with low-risk issues and similar forms of stress.</p>

<p>We talked to 160 students on campus and found that an anonymous texting network could help supplement existing services and friend support networks. The results are displayed below.</p>
