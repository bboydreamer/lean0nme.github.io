Hello reader, thank you for joining us on this adventure! We are Lean On Me, an SMS-based peer support network created by three students: Linda, Nikhil, and Andy. Our vision is to connect people so no one has to struggle alone. To this end, our current mission is to build a painless, personalized, and private texting service, beginning with our home at MIT.

Like many college campuses, the MIT community has been struggling with mental health and related services. In recent history, we've had a record number of suicides and attempted suicides on campus. The Lean On Me team surveyed 170 students to figure out how to tackle these challenges. We came out of these conversations with some key insights.

At the core of the problem is a disconnect between students and their perceived ability to seek help. The campus-wide Healthy Minds Study of last spring showed that 49% of undergraduates polled question the seriousness of their needs as a barrier to obtaining support. The process for getting help on campus begins with calling or walking to the MIT Medical building for an appointment, already an obstacle for someone wanting to be alone and seeking immediate support. Furthermore, students sometimes fear that they'll be forced to leave school if they seek help. A call-in service called Nightline used to exist on campus, but it shut down several years ago due to its the inability to handle spammers. After surveying our classmates, we came to the conclusion that even friends are scared to reach out to one another when they both seem too busy. Lean On Me is our attempt to overcome these roadblocks and lower the barrier to entry for getting help from a caring listener.

We've built an anonymous texting platform on top of Twilio that connects students to peer supporters. Students just text the hotline with a problem and an NLP algorithm extracts some key indicators that we use to make an optimal match based on peer counselor profile and availability. All messages are exchanged in memory, so no conversation ever hits a system hard drive. Privacy is key in a service such as this one.

We're currently piloting the system on MIT's campus, and once we have something that works well, we will begin to explore bringing our tool to college campuses and high schools throughout the country to help everyone get the support they need.
